Welcome to Chapterverse, an innovative platform designed to revolutionize the way users interact with narratives and educational content. Initially developed during the Fall-23 semester at Fanshawe College by Silvio dos Santos Junior, Everton Rodrigues, and Melissa Rodrigues, this project has evolved with additional contributions for the Winter-24 semester by an expanded team including Daniel Coutinho, Lucas Kepler, and Guilherme Parreira.
